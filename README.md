# Spero Weather

## A Basic Weather Application Built With Elm

This is a fun weather application built with Elm. It is very basic and as of yet the functionality has a lot to be desired. It will be worked on as time allows and will thus become better over time. Any help is appreciated.

## Requirements

To run, nothing. Just run the html file. 

To develop on, Elm. If you are new to Elm, then just check out https://guide.elm-lang.org. It has installation instructions and will explain how to get started.
